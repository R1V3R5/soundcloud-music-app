## Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should:

* Have a strong understanding of how to read API documentation and make use of it.
* Have a strong understanding of making an Ajax request and dealing with the response.
* Have an understanding of how to manage state in your application
* Learn how to handle empty values gracefully in a specific property

## Deliverables

1. Submit the URL to your github repo
2. Deploy to Surge.sh and put a link in your `Readme.md`

## Normal Mode

1. Sign up to [SoundCloud for Developers](https://developers.soundcloud.com/) and get an API key
2. Using the wireframe attached below as a guide, build an application that will allow a user to search for any song and then play that song.
3. You will need three key pieces to your app.
    * An audio player using the `<audio>` tag
    * A form that allows a user to enter a song/artist etc title
    * An area to display the results
4. After the results are displayed, I should be able to click the image of any album and play the song associated with it.

## Mockups
